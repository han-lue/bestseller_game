# Bestseller game

This is a simple higher or lower game where you guess which book stayed longer in The New York Times Best Seller List between 1931-2023.

The game is available on: https://bestseller-game.vercel.app/

## Data

Since the official NYT API only contains data from 2008, I collected the data from an [unofficial source](https://www.hawes.com/number1s.htm).

I am constantly updating the data for the game. It currently consists the fiction best sellers from 1931 to 2008. But in the future, I am planing to include non-fiction best sellers as well.
